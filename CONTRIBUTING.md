Capital of Capacity Protocol Contribution Guide
Welcome! We are building a new economic contract for the age of AI, and your contribution is essential. The Capital of Capacity (CC) project is an open-source, community-driven effort.

This document explains how you can get involved, whether you are a cryptographer, economist, or philosopher.

1. Core Project Principles
Before contributing, please ensure your work aligns with these fundamental pillars:

PSA Sovereignty: The Personal Sovereign AI (PSA) code must be immutably owned by the individual and must never include surveillance backdoors.

Privacy by Design: The Proof of Humanity (PoH) must rely on Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) cryptography, ensuring activity data never leaves the userâ€™s device.

Common Good: The Infrastructure Token (IT) must always fund open-source AI projects for universal benefit, not private gain.

2. Priority Contribution Areas
We are currently focused on moving from the Conceptual Manifesto to a Functional Prototype (MVP). We seek contributions in the following high-priority areas:

Area	Key Tasks (See the Issues tab for details)	Languages/Skills
I. Cryptography / Security	PoH Design: Research and propose the best ZKP framework (zk-SNARKs/zk-STARKs) for the Proof of Humanity.	Cryptography, ZKP, Rust/C++, Security Auditing.
II. Economics / IT Protocol	Modeling the initial IBC Emission Formula and its Adjustment Factor. Designing the audit metrics for the Proof of Benefit (PoB).	Decentralized Economics, Mathematical Modeling, Python/R.
III. Code Development	Developing the PSA Secure Wallet Module (MVP). Drafting smart contracts for the Infrastructure Token (IT) on testnet.	Python, Solidity, WebAssembly, Go.
IV. Documentation	Reviewing and enhancing the clarity of the whitepaper. Translations. Drafting guides for new users.	Technical Writing, Markdown, Communication Skills.

3. Contribution Workflow
Follow these simple steps to start working on the repository:

A. For Code (Pull Requests)
Fork: Fork the main repository to your own GitHub account.

Branch: Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., feat/ibc-model or fix/zk-snark-bug).

Implement Changes: Make your changes, ensuring the code is clean and well-commented.

Open a Pull Request (PR): Submit your PR back to the main repository, referencing the specific Issue you are resolving (e.g., Resolves #15: Design of PoB metric).

B. For Ideas and Discussion (Issues)
Review Issues: Check the Issues tab to see which tasks are currently open.

Start Discussion: If you have a fundamental question or an idea that is not code-related, open a new Issue! Tag it with the relevant area (e.g., [ECONOMICS]).

Comment: If you plan to start working on an existing Issue, leave a comment to inform the community and avoid duplicated effort.

4. Code and Documentation Standards
License: All contributions of code and text must adhere to the project's MIT License.

Ethical Alignment: Always prioritize privacy and open source over efficiency or proprietary lock-in.

Thank you for joining us in building the future of human dignity!
